# Data Resources

Inspired by [Awesome Data Sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets/blob/master/README.rst), and combined with my need to catalogue public data sources for research, this repository contains a curated list of data resources that are frequently updated and widely used across various fields. Below you'll find links to each source along with relevant tags and the latest update information to help you find the most relevant and current data.
